# Predicting Subjective Features from Questions on QA Websites using BERT

Modern Question-Answering websites, such as StackOverflow and Quora, have specific user rules to maintain their content quality. These systems rely on user reports for accessing new contents, which has serious problems including the slow handling of violations, the loss of normal and experienced users' time, the low quality of some reports, and discouraging feedback to new users. Therefore, with the overall goal of providing solutions for automating moderation actions in Q&A websites, we aim to provide a model to predict 20 quality or subjective aspects of questions in QA websites. To this end, we used data gathered by the CrowdSource team at Google Research in 2019 and fine-tuned pre-trained BERT model on our problem.
